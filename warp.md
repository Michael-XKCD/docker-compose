## Architecture Analysis

### Service Portfolio

    NPM[Nginx Proxy Manager] --> WP[WordPress]
    NPM --> IM[Immich]
    NPM --> AE[Android Emulator]
    
    WP --> MDB[(MariaDB)]
    IM --> PG[(PostgreSQL)]
    IM --> RD[(Redis)]
    
    NPM -.-> NC[Nextcloud - Migrated]
    NPM -.-> TF[Traefik - Removed]
```

### Network Topology

- External Networks: `proxynet`, `br0`
- Internal Networks: `backend`, service-specific
- Security Model: Internal isolation with proxy egress
- SSL Strategy: NPM handles certificate management

## Service Breakdown

### 1. Nginx Proxy Manager (NPM)
- Type: Reverse Proxy / Load Balancer
- Deployment: Dual (Internal and External)
- Image: `jc21/nginx-proxy-manager`
- Purpose: SSL termination, routing, access control
- Criticality: High (gateway service)

### 2. Immich
- Type: Photo and Video Management
- Architecture: Multi-container (server, ML, database, cache)
- Images:
  - `ghcr.io/immich-app/immich-server`
  - `ghcr.io/immich-app/immich-machine-learning`
  - PostgreSQL and Redis
- Features: AI-powered photo organization, mobile sync
- Criticality: Medium (personal data)

### 3. Android Emulator
- Type: Development and Testing Environment
- Build: Custom Dockerfile
- API Level: 34 (Android 14)
- Access: VNC web interface (port 6080)
- Use Case: App testing, automation
- Criticality: Low (development tool)

### 4. WordPress
- Type: Content Management System
- Domain: mcmurray.tech
- Stack: WordPress and MariaDB
- Images: `wordpress` and `mariadb`
- Purpose: Personal website/blog
- Criticality: Medium (public-facing)

### 5. Nextcloud (Migrated)
- Status: Deprecated → Migrated to AIO
- Reason: Official recommendation from Nextcloud team
- New Deployment: Nextcloud All-in-One container
- Migration Path: Documented in `nextcloud/README.md`

## Technical Insights

### Strengths
1. Network security: Proper isolation with internal networks
2. Version control: Environment variables for image versions
3. Reverse proxy: Centralized SSL and routing
4. Documentation: Comprehensive README and service docs
5. Maintenance: Clear backup and update procedures

### Areas for Improvement
1. Health checks: Missing in most services
2. Resource limits: No CPU/memory constraints
3. Secrets management: Basic .env approach
4. Monitoring: No observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana)
5. Backup automation: Manual backup processes

### Security Analysis
- Internal network isolation
- External proxy for SSL termination
- No direct port exposure to host
- No explicit security scanning
- Default credentials may exist in some services

## Deployment Recommendations

### Production Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Add health checks to all services
- [ ] Implement resource limits
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Add monitoring stack
- [ ] Security scanning integration
- [ ] Secrets management (Docker Secrets/Vault)
- [ ] Log aggregation

### Infrastructure Scaling
```bash
# Current resource estimates
CPU: ~2-4 cores recommended
RAM: ~4-8GB recommended
Storage: ~100GB+ for media services
Network: Reverse proxy handles routing
```

### Monitoring Strategy
```yaml
# Suggested additions
- Prometheus + Grafana
- Container health endpoints
- Log aggregation (ELK stack)
- Uptime monitoring
- SSL certificate expiry alerts
```

## Migration History

| Date | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| Oct 2024 | Removed Traefik | Simplified to NPM-only proxy |
| Oct 2024 | Nextcloud → AIO | Moved to official deployment |
| Oct 2024 | Updated README | Improved documentation |
| Oct 2024 | Added Warp Analysis | Enhanced project insights |

## Strategic Direction

### Short Term (1-3 months)
1. Implement health checks
2. Add resource limits
3. Set up automated backups
4. Security audit and hardening

### Medium Term (3-6 months)
1. Add monitoring stack
2. Implement secrets management
3. Container image vulnerability scanning
4. Performance optimization

### Long Term (6+ months)
1. Kubernetes migration evaluation
2. Multi-host deployment
3. Disaster recovery procedures
4. Advanced networking (Mesh)

## AI Integration Opportunities

- Immich: Uses machine learning for photo recognition
- WordPress: Content generation plugins
- Monitoring: Anomaly detection in metrics
- Security: AI-assisted threat detection

## Maintenance Runbook

### Weekly Tasks
- Check service status: `docker compose ps`
- Review logs: `docker compose logs --tail=50`
- Monitor resource usage: `docker stats`

### Monthly Tasks
- Update images: `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`
- Cleanup unused images: `docker image prune`
- Backup critical volumes
- SSL certificate status check

### Quarterly Tasks
- Security audit
- Performance review
- Documentation updates
- Disaster recovery test
